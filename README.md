# Data Analysis Using R

This repository contains my learning journey into **programming with R**, starting from the basics. I’m following the excellent free YouTube course by **Prof. Danny Arends**, which you can find here:

I’m learning and practicing as I go, and I’ve included my scripts for each lecture in this repository. It’s a work in progress, and I welcome anyone who wants to follow along or explore the material.
